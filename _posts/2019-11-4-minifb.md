## Overview

In this project, I used Mininet to emulate a network topology consisting of one server and three client nodes and implement a simple Facebook application on top of this topology using a client - server model. Clients run client codes to make use of the capabilities they are provided with and the server is responsible for authenticating users, receiving posts and messages from users and sending them to the proper intended recipient.

## How to Use

1. You need to have a Mininet VM setup with a local NAT
2. SSH into Mininet and run 'bash runTopol.sh'
3. A few windows will pop up. Find the one called S1 and run the server code
4. In the windows that start with C, run the client code
5. Login with username and password, select menu options, and enjoy
