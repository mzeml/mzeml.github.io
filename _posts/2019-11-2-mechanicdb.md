## Overview

A two-person project for my database class where we created an SQL database for a car mechanic shop.

We started with the initial data to be inserted, a skeleton of the Java interface, and some scripts to help everything run. From there, we created an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram that followed the requirements given to us. After that, we created the correct quires for the database as well as implemented error checking.  Data had to be entered through a Java interface, so we had to create query functions in Java. When we finished, we demoed the project and got full points.

Thank you to my partner Jasiel Jimenez for working with me on this project. Check out his GitHub [here](https://github.com/JasielJimenez)
