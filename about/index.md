   <center>I am a current student at the University of California, Riverside majoring in Computer Science with Business Applications (Graduating June 2019). Most of my projects use C++, but I have been expanding into Python, SQL, and Java. I enjoy learning as much as I can when I can, with the mantra that you should learn something new every day! If you would like to get in contact with me, feel free to email me or connect on LinkedIn. </center>
